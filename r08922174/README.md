# DMLS2020-FinalProj-Centralized training
## R08922174

### Setups
Following Cheng-han's setup:
1. Apply Weighted Sampler
2. Standarize data before training

### How to run
One can simply change ```--train_path``` and ```--validation_path``` in ArgumentParser.

Run something such as: python3 local_full_train.py [personal args (optional)]

### Cautions
1. One should not set learning rate as large as 0.01, my default value is 0.001.
2. Centralized training, my training dataset comes from combining four siteX image floders, and the validation dataset remains the same as folder generated by sep_data.py.
3. How to obtain such training & validation image folders? 
    simply run my combine_site_data.sh after checking path's correctness and running Frank's sep_data.py!
4. Don't bother to specify arguments, since default values should work fine.

### Result
Dataset size: 35289
